# Absolut

Absolut stands for "**A**utogenerated **B**ytewise **S**IMD-**O**ptimized **L**ook-**U**p **T**ables".
The following is a breakdown of this jargon:

- **Bytewise Lookup Table**: One-to-one mappings between sets of bytes.

- **SIMD-Optimized**: Said lookup tables are implemented using SIMD (Single Instruction Multipe Data) 
  instructions, such as `PSHUFB` on x86_64 and `TBL` on AArch64.

- **Autogenerated**: This crate utilizes [Procedural Macros](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/procedural-macros.html) 
  to generate (if possible) SIMD lookup tables given a human-readable byte-to-byte mapping.

## Why?

SIMD instructions allow for greater data parallelism when performing table lookups on bytes. This is
has proved incredibly useful for high-performance data processing[^1].

Unfortunately, SIMD table lookup instructions (or byte suffling instructions) operate on tables too small
to cover the entire 8-bit integer space. These tables typically have a size of 16 on x86_64, while
on AArch64 tables of up to 64 elements are supported.

This library facilitates generation of SIMD lookup tables from high-level descriptions of byte-to-byte mappings.
The goal being to avoid the need to 
[hardcode manually-computed](https://github.com/simd-lite/simd-json/blob/main/src/impls/sse42/stage1.rs#L22) 
SIMD lookup tables, thus enabling a wider audience to utilize these techniques more easily.
