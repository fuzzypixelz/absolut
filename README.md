# Absolut

Absolut stands for "**A**utogenerated **B**ytewise **S**IMD-**O**ptimized **L**ook-**U**p **T**ables".
The following is a breakdown of this jargon:

**Bytewise Lookup Table**: One-to-one mappings between sets of bytes.

**SIMD-Optimized**: Said lookup tables are implemented using SIMD (Single Instruction Multipe Data) 
instructions, such as `PSHUFB` on x86_64 and `TBL` on AArch64.

**Autogenerated**: This crate utilizes [Procedural Macros](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/procedural-macros.html) 
to generate (if possible) SIMD lookup tables given a human-readable byte-to-byte mapping.
